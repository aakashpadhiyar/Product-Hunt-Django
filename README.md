# Product-Hunt-Django
      Product Hunt is a website that lets users share and discover new products. The site,
      which was founded by Ryan Hoover in November 2013, is backed by Y Combinator. Users
      submit products which are listed in a linear format by day. The site includes a comments
      system and a voting system similar to Hacker News or Reddit. The products with the most 
      votes rise to the top of each day's list. Clone
